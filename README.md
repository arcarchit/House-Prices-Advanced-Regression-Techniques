# House-Prices-Advanced-Regression-Techniques
Predict sales prices and practice feature engineering, Dissertation


Housing price prediction is a classic problem for regression and predictive modeling. It generally contains feature like nearby area, no of bedrooms, parking facilities etc and task is to predict the price of the house. In this work we will be exploring various regression techniques for the prediction task. Our focus will be more on mathematic for linear regression and Bayesian regression. We will also try various implementation for these models and evaluate their performance.
